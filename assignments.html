                <h3>Assignment 0: Dummy Assignment</h3>
                <p>This dummy assignment is a practice exercise for submitting assignments in this course. It involves writing a simple Python script to add two numbers together and print their sum.</p>

                <p>This assignment focuses on collecting data about elevator arrival times and analyzing it to determine the optimal standing position to minimize walking distance to the next elevator. Python was used to process and analyze the data.</p>

                <h3>Assignment 2: KMeans Clustering Visualization</h3>
                <p>This assignment involves implementing the KMeans clustering algorithm from scratch and developing an interactive web application to visualize different initialization strategies (Random, Farthest First, KMeans++, and Manual). I structured the application with React for the UI and used JavaScript to implement the algorithm, carefully designing it to allow for dynamic updates at each step. The project was approached by first implementing the algorithm with a focus on efficiency and then adding various visualization modes to display how the clustering progresses over time. A demonstration of the project can be viewed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFMGrzYAwZ4&ab_channel=DavidKaplansky" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                <h3>Assignment 3: SVD Preprocessing and Logistic Regression on MNIST</h3>
                <p>In this assignment, I applied Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) as a preprocessing technique on the MNIST dataset, followed by training a logistic regression model to classify the digits. I compared model performance and training time across different levels of dimensionality reduction by varying the number of SVD components. The results showed a clear trade-off between accuracy and training efficiency. Additionally, I visualized the top 5 singular vectors to gain insight into the features captured by SVD.</p>

                <h3>Assignment 4: LSA Search Engine using 20 Newsgroups</h3>
                <p>This assignment involves developing a basic search engine that implements Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) to retrieve documents based on user queries. The search engine uses the Scikit-learn version of the 20 Newsgroups dataset and ranks documents using cosine similarity. The project includes a web application that allows users to input queries and returns the top relevant documents. LSA was applied to reduce dimensionality and improve search relevance by capturing latent patterns in the document-term matrix.

                <h3>Assignment 5: KNN Customer Churn Prediction</h3>
                <p>In this assignment, I implemented a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model from scratch to predict customer churn for a bank. The project involved preprocessing the customer data, training and evaluating the KNN model, and tuning hyperparameters to improve performance. The final model was submitted to a Kaggle competition to compare performance against other participants. I utilized various techniques for data normalization and feature selection to optimize the modelâ€™s accuracy and efficiency.</p>

                <h3>Midterm</h3>
                <p>The objective of this project is to predict the star ratings of Amazon Movie Reviews using the available features. This document outlines the final algorithm implemented, the feature engineering techniques employed, the rationale behind model selection, and the special methods used to enhance performance. The focus is on the analytical approach and insights gained rather than on code specifics.</p>

                <h3>Assignment 6: Linear Regression</h3>
                <p>For this assignment, I developed a Flask web application that allows users to explore how randomness impacts linear regression. By setting parameters like sample size, mean, variance, and the number of simulations, users can generate random data and see how regression lines vary in the absence of true relationships. The application includes interactive scatter plots and histograms that visualize the slope and intercept distributions from multiple simulations.
